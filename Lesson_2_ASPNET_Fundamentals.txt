Recall that from the previous section, we left off with assigning an action
result with regards to the movie controller in which we assigned the movie
model with a random title and had it display on the Movie\Random screen. 

We did this by passing the movie model through the controller to the view.

	an alternate method of instead through returning the View(movie);, it can
	just be done through:
							return ViewResult();
	method which is inherent to asp.net MVC.

A question you should be asking now is why the function which is asking for an
ActionResult datatype to be returned is actually just a View? Well, we can
actually just have the method return a ViewResult instead (as good practice)
and for unit testing.
	-> which saves the task of casting compiling
	a ViewResult as an ActionResult too.

A quick nomenclature setup is as follows:
Type					HelperMethod
ViewResult				View()
PartialViewResult		PartialView() ->parts of a view
ContentResult			Content() ->like text
									ex return("Hello");
									just has Hello on the page, no styling
RedirectResult			Redirect() -> to a different URL
RedirectToRouteResult	RedirectToAction() -> Redirect to action instead of URL
									ex: return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home",
												new{page = 1, sortBy = "name"});
											Index action from the Home Controller
											with an anonymous object.
											This anon object is returned in url
											query string.
JsonResult				Json() ->Serialized Json Object
FileResult				File()
HttpNotFoundResult		HttpNotFound() -> Not Found or 404 error
EmptyResult				Action doesn't need to return anything -> like void
							this one needs a return new EmptyResult();

///////////////////////////////

within the movie controller, we can create a queryable string entry
		//GET: Movies/Edit/id
		//displays id = "id" on the new screen
		//can also query string this now via edit?id=1
		public ActionResult Edit(int id)
		{
			return Content("id=" + id);
		}

But what if we had changed the passed in variable not as "id" but as "movieId"?
we will get an error because this was not explicitly set to movieId
	to change this, we go to the routeConfig.cs file and observe the url: in the routes.MapRoute setting
		this says "id"

///////////////////////////////////

        //in this call, we can request all movies in the database
        //defaults to page 1 if no index is passed)
        //if no sortBy is passed through, then we sort by the movies by 
        //their name automatically
        //to make a parameter optional, we must first make it nullable
        //this is implied via a "?" beside the datatype
        //string types are a reference type in C# and are therefore nullable automatically
        public ActionResult Index(int? pageIndex, string sortBy)
        {
            if (!pageIndex.HasValue)
                pageIndex = 1;

            if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(sortBy))
                sortBy = "Name";

            //for the purpose of this demo
            return Content(String.Format("pageIndex={0} sortby={1}", pageIndex, sortBy));
        }
    }

	Note: we can override this parameter by querying movies?pageIndex=2&sortby=Title
			in which, after the page reference, we can string and set the parameters after '?'
			setting them by declaring values through '=' and chaining through '&'
